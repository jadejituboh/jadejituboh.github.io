    Hi Everyone. My name is Jade Jituboh-Aluyi. I turned 22 on January the 16th and I'm a Chemical Engineering Major. I grew up in Nigeria and moved to America four years ago (shortly after my 18th birthday). I attended boarding school all throughout high school and I would say that was the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire 22 years on earth. I have made my lifelong friends from boarding school, and it is one of the pillars of my personality and mentality so far. From living in the dorms, I have acquired resilience, diligence and I have no attachment to what some would call a home. These qualities are very useful in my day to day activities and especially in my chosen career field as it is a very complex and hard one. I am a math and chemistry minor with a interest In coding hence why I'm pursuing an information systems certificate too
