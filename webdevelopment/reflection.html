    <p>Despite how hard my major is, I have genuinely developed a love for it. I have also
        come to appreciate and respect how hard chemical engineers work on and off the field. From
        my first ever Mass and Energy Balance class to my current Thermodynamic 2 class, each
        subject has deepened my appreciation for the major at large.</p>
    <p>Embarking on my journey as a junior in chemical engineering, with minors in mathematics and chemistry, 
       has been both challenging and rewarding. The rigorous curriculum has almost pushed me to my breaking point,
       especially when facing really complex concepts in thermodynamics and all three calculus classes i had to take. 
       Initially, these challenges felt like it could not be overcome, leading to moments of self-doubt and frustration. However, as I progressed, I began to appreciate the depth of the subjects and the major,
       transforming obstacles into opportunities for growth.</p>
    <p>One of the most significant lessons I've learned is the value of resilience. Facing academic setbacks taught me that perseverance is key to overcoming difficulties.
        Each failure became a stepping stone, reinforcing the importance of persistence and adaptability. This mindset not only improved my academic performance but also prepared me for real-world engineering problems, where solutions are rarely straightforward</p>
    <p>Diligence has also been a cornerstone of my academic journey. The demanding nature of chemical engineering and the complementary minors required meticulous time management and unwavering commitment.
       Through countless hours in the laboratory and late-night study sessions, I developed a strong work ethic and attention to detail. These qualities are indispensable in engineering, where precision and thoroughness are paramount</p>
    <p>Reflecting on my experiences, I've come to realize that the struggles I faced were instrumental in shaping my passion for the field. The initial challenges fostered a deeper understanding and appreciation for chemical engineering, mathematics, and chemistry.
       As I look toward the future, I am committed to applying these values of resilience and diligence in my career, continuously seeking opportunities to learn and contribute meaningfully to the field.</p>
